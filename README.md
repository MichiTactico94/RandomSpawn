Random Spawn Plugin
This plugin makes players spawn at random points on the map that you define in the config.yml.

How to Install:
Place the .phar file into your server's plugins folder.

Configure the world where you want the random spawn to be functional by editing the config.yml file.

After saving the changes, run /reload on your server to apply the plugin (if it doesn't load automatically).

Once done, everything will be configured and ready to use!
